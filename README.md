# Week-1
This repository is for a project on **Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning**. It contains a crops dataset and a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and observing the data. Currently, the repository focuses only on crop data and does not include fertilizer recommendation information, with plans for future updates to extend functionality.
